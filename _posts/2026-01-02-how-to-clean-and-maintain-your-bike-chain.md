=====================================================================

As a cyclist, you know that a well-maintained bike is essential for performance, safety, and longevity. One of the most critical components of your bike is the chain. A dirty or worn-out chain can lead to poor shifting, reduced power transfer, and even breakage. In this article, we'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to clean and maintain your bike chain, as well as some top product recommendations to make the process easier.

**Section 1: Why Clean Your Bike Chain?**
