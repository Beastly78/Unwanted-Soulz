**Best Motorcycle Helmets Under $200: A Comprehensive Guide**

As a motorcycle rider, safety is one of the top priorities. One of the most critical safety gear investments you can make is a high-quality helmet. Not only will it protect your head in the event of an accident, but it will also provide wind noise reduction, improved visibility, and a more comfortable riding experience.

When it comes to choosing a helmet, there are several options available, ranging from budget-friendly choices to high-end models. However, finding a reliable helmet that fits within a budget of $200 can be a challenge. In this article, we'll explore the best motorcycle helmets under $200, considering factors such as safety features, comfort, and durability.

**Section 1: Understanding Helmet Safety Features**

Before diving into our top picks, it's essential to understand the key safety features to look for in a motorcycle helmet. These include:

* **DOT Certification**: Look for helmets certified by the Department of Transportation (DOT). This ensures that the helmet meets certain safety standards.
* **Snell Certification**: While not required by law, Snell certification is a more stringent standard that guarantees extra safety features.
* **Impact Protection**: The helmet should be able to absorb the impact of a crash and protect your head and brain.
* **Visibility**: A clear visor and adequate field of vision can help prevent accidents.

**Section 2: Comfort and Fit**

A comfortable helmet is essential for long rides. Consider the following factors:

* **Weight**: A lightweight helmet can reduce fatigue and strain on your neck and shoulders.

* **Breathability**: Adequate ventilation can help prevent fogging and sweating.

**Section 3: Durability and Build Quality**

A quality helmet should last for years, not just seasons. Look for:
