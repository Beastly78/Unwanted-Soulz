Choosing the right helmet can be overwhelming, especially with so many options on the market. But with a budget of $200 or less, you can find an excellent helmet that will protect your head while also looking great on your bike. In this article, we'll cover five key sections that will help you find the perfect helmet for your needs.

## **Section 1: Understanding Helmet Safety Standards**

Before we dive into the best motorcycle helmets under $200, it's essential to understand the safety standards that these helmets must meet. The US Department of Transportation (DOT) sets the standards for motorcycle helmets in the United States. To ensure a helmet meets the DOT standard, it must pass a series of safety tests, including:

* Impact testing: The helmet must be able to absorb the impact of a crash and prevent serious injury to the wearer's head.
* Penetration testing: The helmet must be able to prevent a penetration of the skull by a sharp object.
* Flotation testing: The helmet must be able to provide adequate buoyancy to keep the wearer's head above water.

In addition to the DOT standard, many helmets meet the Snell Memorial Foundation's safety standard, which is considered to be more rigorous. Snell-certified helmets have been tested for both impact and penetration, and they are designed to meet the highest safety standards.

## **Section 2: What to Look for in a Helmet**

When shopping for a motorcycle helmet, there are several key features to consider. Here are some of the most important factors to look for:

* **Safety Rating**: Look for helmets that meet the DOT or Snell safety standard.
* **Fit**: A helmet that fits properly is essential for safety and comfort. Make sure to try on several different helmets to find the best fit for your head.
* **Ventilation**: Good ventilation is essential for keeping you cool and comfortable while riding. Look for helmets with multiple vents and a cooling system to keep you comfortable.
* **Weight**: Lighter helmets can be more comfortable, but they may not provide the same level of protection.
* **Visor**: A helmet with a built-in visor can help protect your eyes from the sun, wind, and rain.
