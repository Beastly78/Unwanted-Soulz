**Section 1: Safety Features to Look For**
---------------------------------------

When shopping for a motorcycle helmet under $200, prioritize essential safety features to ensure you're protected on the road. Here are the key elements to consider:

* **Snell or DOT Certification**: A Snell or DOT certificate ensures your helmet meets rigorous safety standards, such as impact resistance, penetration resistance, and retention system security. Look for this seal of approval when making your purchase.
* **Impact Absorption**: A quality helmet should absorb impact effectively, dissipating shock to minimize the risk of head injuries.
* **Wind Noise Reduction**: Reduced wind noise improves communication while riding, reducing driver fatigue and improving overall riding experience.
* **Visibility**: Opt for a helmet with a clear, unobstructed field of vision to enhance visibility and reaction time.

**Section 2: Choosing the Right Style**
--------------------------------------

Once you've prioritized safety features, it's time to consider style and comfort. Here are some factors to keep in mind:

* **Shell Shape and Size**: Consider the type of riding you'll be doing and choose a helmet that suits your needs. Full-face, open-face, and half-shell helmets cater to different preferences and riding styles.
* **Weight and Comfort**: Lighter helmets reduce fatigue, while ergonomic designs prioritize comfort and adjustability.
